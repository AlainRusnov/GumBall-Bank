- Need to redesign and implement fully functional account dashboard ( can be found here https://alainrusnov.github.io/gumball-dashboard/ )
- Add scroll element on images (?)
- replace placeholder images with customized assets
- review for readibility UX
- refactor and assign for performance
- pwa (?)


The goal of Gumball Bank was to create a SPA with only pure language.
The challenge was to not use frameworks. No libraries. No abstraction. See what happens.
Coded using vanilla JS, html, css.
